# Movies-ETL
Using ETL, Pandas, Python, JSON

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project we used Pandas and numpy as dependencies, we were using a .json provided from a web page where you can find data bases for the movies existed over the world, we analize .csv files which contained also movies information.


### Purpose

The tarjet, once we have all the mentioned aboved, is to apply filters to those data bases files in order to clean the info, due there are many information repetead and without congruence or there are mispelled info. Secondly, once we have reviewed the correct raws we want in our cleaned data base, we merge these data frames in order to create our final data frame which will be exported to PgAdmin.

I should mentioned that before these files are imported, a data base should have been created (movie_data) so finally we can make queries in our tables displayed (movies, ratings). 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The most challenged part in this challenge was to make the canvas code fit in the files provided to make the challenge, because in canvas we just wrote code in many lines and in the challenge files, we code everithing in just around 6 lines.

## Results

We van say that we got the info in PgAdmin which was exported from jupyter notebook. The raitings table took a considerable time to be filled with the info, and I consider it is very useful, to work first with jupyter notebook and then to have our info in PgAdmin where we can as many queries as we want.
